## How It Works

* The **typewriter effect** in `dashboard.js` animates the welcome message letter by letter inside the `<p>` with id `typewriter`.
* The **particle background** uses a CSS repeating radial gradient animated with `@keyframes` for subtle motion.
* The **glowing button** reacts on hover with smooth color and scale transformations.
* The typography combines `'Orbitron'` for headers and `'Roboto'` for body text to create a futuristic yet readable feel.
